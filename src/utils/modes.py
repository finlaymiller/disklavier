    """
    Find the path from source to destination with the smallest average edge cost.

    This function uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore paths from source
    to destination with at most `max_nodes` nodes, where each node can be visited
    up to `max_visits` times. It selects the path with the lowest average edge cost.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph
        A weighted graph with a 'weight' attribute on each edge.
    source : str
        The starting node.
    destination : str
        The target node.
    played_files : list[str]
        List of files/nodes that should be avoided in the path.
    max_nodes : int
        The maximum number of nodes allowed in the path. Defaults to 5.
    max_updates : int
        The maximum number of times to update the best path. Defaults to 20.
    max_visits : int
        Maximum number of times a node can be visited. Defaults to 1 for simple paths.
        Set to 0 to run simple djikstra, 2 or higher to allow revisiting nodes.
    allow_same_seg: bool
        If True, allow revisiting transformations of the same segment. Defaults to False.
    verbose: bool
        If True, print verbose output. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple or None
        A tuple (path, total_cost) where path is a list of nodes representing the
        path with the smallest average edge cost, and total_cost is the sum of
        weights along that path; or None if no such path exists.
